        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! Welcome to my website~
It is my pleasure to have you reading through my story, I did not have much experience with work or join the college club. Yet, I have the enthusiasm to know more about them. In the meanwhile, I also hope you can get to know me better through this page. <br><br>

        It is my pleasure to have you reading through my story, I did not have much experience with work or join the college club. Yet, I have the enthusiasm to know more about them. In the meanwhile, I also hope you can get to know me better through this page. 
I am a Taiwanese girl. The very first time I come to the United States was in 2015. I was here as an exchange student, thus it was a one-year short trip for me. Therefore, I study English harder than ever before to win the chance to come back to the United States again. Now, I am a college student who studies at the University of California — Riverside as a Sophomore international student. As I keep learning and practice languages, I am available with the language English and Chinese. I can speak both of the languages very well, thus feel free to talk to me in the language you are more comfortable with. 
Before I enroll in college, I was one of the student association members in my high school. I really enjoy the time I can help other students with their concerns about school policy. At the same time, I also enjoy the time I could hold events for the entire school. It was a lot of fun in the process of planning and preparing. Thus, I always feel as a pleasure to help out someone else. Even though it takes time to figure out the issue or problem, however, what it comes later is more than my effort. 
I am a very patient person, thus please reach out to me at any time while you need me. I did not have a lot of experience before this, yet I believe in myself can do better with a good heart.   <br><br>

        It is hard to pronounce my name in English, so please can call me Angel. I believe it will be easier to remember and easier to pronounce for you. Please feel free to reach out to me with anything that you curious with study abroad, how to study abroad, what to prepare for study abroad, etc. Before you have your question, please first let me know your name, your age, your location, your interest, any idea about study abroad, and what language you speak. It is better to write down and organize your thought before me meet us and discuss about it. I strongly recommend you to do some research about the country you interest in, the school you like, and the major you might enroll in.  However, even you did not prepare anything before our meeting because you have no idea about study abroad, it is fine! I will do my best to help you find out the answers. The following items will lead you to my social account, either one will be a good way to contact me. I will be here waiting for your call. I am excited to hear from you!
Can't wait to meet with you ~
